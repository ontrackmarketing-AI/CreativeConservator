## URL Structure Analysis

### Pattern
- Trailing slashes on all URLs
- Simple, flat structure
- WordPress standard format
- Clean, readable slugs

### Site Architecture
```
/
├── /about/
├── /services/
└── /contact/
```

## On-Page Anchors

| Anchor | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `#reach` | Contact/inquiry form section |

---

## Observations

1. **Minimal pages** - Only 4 main pages
2. **Single-page focus** - Long homepage with sections
3. **Anchor links** - Multiple CTAs link to same form
4. **No blog** - Content-focused but no blog section
5. **No portfolio** - Results shown but no dedicated portfolio

---

## Recommendations for Creative Conservator

Similar minimal structure could work:
```
/
├── /about/ (or /story/)
├── /services/
│   ├── /brand-strategy/
│   ├── /identity-development/
│   ├── /content-creation/
│   └── /social-media-management/
├── /work/ (portfolio - add this)
├── /journal/ (blog - add this)
└── /contact/
```

**Consider:** Adding dedicated portfolio and blog sections that KSM lacks, to showcase creative work and thought leadership.

## Gap Analysis for Creative Conservator

### What Competitors Do Well
1. Clear value propositions in hero sections
2. Social proof through testimonials
3. Service categorization
4. Newsletter/email capture
5. Instagram integration

### What's Missing Across All
1. No luxury/classical aesthetic (opportunity for differentiation)
2. Limited focus on brand strategy depth
3. No sophisticated copywriting emphasis
4. Missing refined artistic positioning

### Creative Conservator Opportunity
Position as the **elevated, artistic alternative** with:
- Classical aesthetic (marble, velvet, still-life imagery)
- Deep red/wine/cream color palette
- Didone serif typography
- Focus on "cultivating artistry, crafting identity"
- Services that emphasize strategic depth and creative refinement
